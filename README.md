# Aperol_Mixer
The Instagram Famous Aperol Mixer

You're probably here from following the link on kate_ivy_peace's instagram showing the Aperol dispenser I made her https://www.instagram.com/kate_ivy_peace/reel/DRjfJR4iDU8/

The following are some fairly rubbish instructions on how to make yourself a version of this wonderful device.

BoM:
-3 diaphragm pumps.  This is the basis of the whole thing.  The diameter of the pumps you use will drive the size of everything elseI used these but others are available - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008389360033.html?algo_exp_id=38f3a638-18dc-47c7-ad9f-794de28863fa-1&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%2255%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%2C%22fromPage%22%3A%22search%22%7D&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A%7Cx_object_id%3A1005008389360033%7C_p_origin_prod%3A

-Arduino nano

-Solderless Breadboad small enough to fit in the footprint that you use.  I had to dremel the corners off mine

-16x2 i2C LCD display

-Rotary encoder.  Mine was out of a BMW M5, funnily enough.

-Load cell to detect if there is a glass in place to catch the aperol.  I used a 750g one, you might need to change this if you are using huge glasses and delivering pints of cocktail
